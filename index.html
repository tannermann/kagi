            <h2>Carnitas</h2>
            <a id="show-more" class="show-less" href="#show-less">Show less</a>

            <p>
              To make deliciously tender and flavorful carnitas, start by selecting a well-marbled
              pork shoulder, around 3 to 4 pounds in weight. This cut of meat is ideal for slow
              cooking, thanks to its rich fat content and deep flavor. Begin by trimming off any
              excessive fat from the pork—while a bit of fat is essential for taste and moisture,
              you will want to remove any overly large chunks. Once trimmed, cut the pork into
              large, rustic chunks, about two inches wide, so they hold up well during the long
              cook. Lightly coat the pork pieces with a drizzle of avocado oil or extra virgin olive
              oil, then season them generously with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. To build
              flavor, sprinkle in a tablespoon each of dried oregano and ground cumin, giving the
              meat an earthy, aromatic kick. Place the seasoned pork into your slow cooker, nestling
              it in snugly. Add one small chopped onion and six peeled garlic cloves to infuse the
              meat with extra depth. Next, pour in the fresh juice from three large oranges and two
              limes—this citrus bath not only tenderizes the pork but also imparts a bright, tangy
              note that perfectly balances the richness of the meat. Cover and set your crockpot to
              cook on low for about eight hours. If you're short on time, you can use a pressure
              cooker instead—just cook the pork for 45 minutes and allow the steam to release
              naturally once it is done. After the pork is cooked to perfection—fall-apart tender
              and swimming in a pool of flavorful juices—it is time for the final, and perhaps most
              satisfying, step: crisping it up. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add a
              small amount of oil. Take a few chunks of the cooked pork, give them a gentle squish
              to break them open slightly, and place them in the hot pan. Spoon in a little of the
              cooking liquid to keep things moist and flavorful as they sear. Let them sit
              undisturbed so one side gets beautifully caramelized and crispy. Once golden and
              sizzling, remove the pork from the pan and serve immediately—either on warm tortillas,
              over rice, or alongside your favorite toppings. These carnitas are tender, juicy on
              the inside, with irresistible crispy edges that make them an absolute crowd-pleaser.
